### UV Face Color Picker
Vertex colors only allow you to specify a single color per vertex. Because of that you can not assign a solid color to a face without splitting vertices (create individual loops).
This addon allows you to split a texture (e.g color palatte) into distinct areas and then select individual faces of the object and assign their UV coordinates to these areas. A great way to create UV maps to colorize your low poly game assets.
